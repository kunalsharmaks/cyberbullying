<p>Q. Why does cyber bullying still exists?</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>         <br>

<p>Probably for much the same reason that people believe any form of abuse doesn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;denial. It&rsquo;s easier to say that the victim should &ldquo;grow a thicker skin&rdquo; or &ldquo;stop being so defensive&rdquo; than to admit that someone is being abusive and the victim has every right to be offended. Many people still think that verbal/written bullying is only about racial slurs, harassment of someone with a physical/mental disability, threats of physical harm, and other older-fashioned methods, like those utilized by elementary schoolers. However, most verbal abuse today is much more mainstream, taking the form of someone &ldquo;expressing their thoughts/feelings&rdquo; in such a way as to tear down someone else.</p>
