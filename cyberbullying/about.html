      Cyber bullying is primarily psychological as its perpetrated through social manipulation and intimidation via messaging and interference with one’s social status through message boards and groups. Cyber bullying has ruined countless innocent lives and carriers.
   <br>
   <br>
We have created a portal that will basically accept complaints against cyber bullies along with immediate actions. We would also provide the precautions and the solutions regarding the particular crimes. Authentication will be maintained.
<br>
<br>
We are also going to look after the victim by providing him/her consolation so that they can get over with the shock or depression they feel. We will also lay emphasis on securing the personal accounts. Such as in any other website we provide the authenticated unique password, we would similarly provide it here, so as to have a share of experience which might be done anonymously or the identity might be revealed on the basis of consent.
We will also discuss about the malicious sites and networks to prevent from spywares. There are several cases, where we acknowledged cyber threats due to opening of ransomware websites and mails.
